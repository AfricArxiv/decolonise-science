# Decolonise Science
Decolonise Science, Call for submissions

The team at AfricArXiv is proud to announce that we are partnering with [Masakhane](https://masakhane.io/) to build a multilingual parallel corpus of African research from translations of research manuscripts submitted to AfricArXiv. Of the articles submitted, the teams at Masakhane and AfricArXiv will select up to 180 in total for translation.

From the grant announcement:

*When it comes to scientific communication and education, language matters. The ability for science to be discussed in local indigenous languages can not only help expand knowledge to those who do not speak English or French as a first language, but also can integrate the facts and methods of science into cultures that have been denied it in the past. Thus, the team will build a multilingual parallel corpus of African research, by translating African preprint research papers released on AfricArxiv into 6 diverse African languages: isiZulu, Northern Sotho, Yoruba, Hausa, Luganda, Amharic.*

# other ways to decolonising academia
Strategies to build a global academic community inclusive of all world regions from an African perspectives



## Ethical review processes when working with local communities
- regulating the ways medical doctors conduct research on their patients
- safeguard against the exploitation of research participants
- determining what is acceptable behaviour or methodology for the researcher
- fully understand the position as researchers from an elite university in the context of the lives of peoples in Africa
- understand the place in the systematic extraction of resources before entering the field
- examine the Western infrastructure of ethics that are brought to the continent and the way it interacts with national and regional ethical frameworks
- (western) universities cannot treat ethics as a ‘one-size fits all’ model

**Applies to these topics and disciplines**

Cultural Studies, Ethnology
- interviews with local communities
- …

Life Sciences
- medical examinations and biostatistics
- conservation biology on indigenous territory
- …

**Challenges**
- 

**Approach**
- ensure free, prior and informed consent: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free,_prior_and_informed_consent
- negotiate terms and let the community decide on their ROI / reimbursement (what is the gain from the collaboration?)(
