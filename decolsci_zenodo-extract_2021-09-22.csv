Around 320 mammalian species, including 39 endemics, 918 bird species, including 19 endemics, 240 reptile species (16 endemics), 71 amphibian species (30 endemics), 172 freshwater fish species, including 38 endemics, and more than 1225 insect species have been scientifically reported in Ethiopia. However, Ethiopia&#39;s wildlife is in peril right now. Therefore this review was aimed to identify the major challenges of wildlife conservation in Ethiopia and to suggest a possible solution based on the review results. Deforestation, road kills of wildlife along highways, wildlife trafficking, lack of law enforcement, climate change, human-wildlife conflict, and land-use change are the identified challenges of wildlife conservation in Ethiopia. Develop a collaborative approach, invasive species utilization, promote community involvement and awareness creation are the suggested strategy that can bring solutions to the challenges of wildlife conservation.</em></p>",18,1,"Dida Abkiyo","Oromia Agricultural Research Institute","0000-0003-2768-4628","2021-09-02","2021-09-06","CC-BY-4.0",

<p>It has been suggested that the ultimate function of academic research is not simply publication in arcane journals, but to assist in rebuilding our social realities. Therefore, free access to information is could be considered a basic human right in the current information age. Mutual exchange of scientific knowledge between developed and developing countries maybe essential for reducing global health inequalities and improving human development index (HDI). For instance, free exchange of biomedical research information could be of enormous benefit in bridging the 10/90 gap, whereby 90% of global research funding is directed towards finding cures for diseases affecting 10% of human populations. However, recent scientometric analysis of worldwide publications revealed that researchers from developing countries produced approximately 10% of global academic publications, while those from Europe, North America, and China, produce over 80% of scientific publications. This skewed publication data maybe attributed not only to resource constraints in developing countries, but other factors like institutionalized racism, bias against diseases of poverty, Mathew effect, and poor representation of developing country researchers in editorial/advisory boards of high impact international scientific journals. This paper interrogates the evidence for such discriminatory practices, from the perspectives of viewpoint discrimination, global justice, and human rights. Minimizing such putative limitations on free speech may require improved diversity of journal editorial/advisory boards, better acknowledgment of joint technology innovations, and other affirmative actions, thereby assisting in closing the information gap, curtail global health inequities, and improve overall global human development index.</p>",10,10,"Chima, Sylvester C.","Programme of Bio & Research Ethics and Medical Law,  School of Nursing and Public Health and Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa","0000-0001-7067-6469","2021-08-31","2021-09-02","CC-BY-4.0","Africa, bibliographic negligence, citation amnesia, developing countries, discrimination, free speech, global south, human development index, implicit bias, Mathew effect, systemic and institutionalized racism, viewpoint discrimination."

It represents one of the most comprehensive descriptions of a northwestern Bantu language.</p>

<p>The grammatical description, which is couched in a form-to-function approach, covers all levels of language, ranging from Gyeli phonology to its information structure and complex clauses.</p>

<p>It draws on nineteen months of fieldwork carried out as part of the &quot;Bagyeli/Bakola&quot; DoBeS (Documentation of Endangered Languages) project between 2010 and 2014. The resulting multimodal corpus from that project, which includes texts of diverse genres such as traditional stories, narratives, multi-party conversations and dialogues, procedural texts, and songs, provides the empirical basis for the grammatical description. The documentary text collection, supplemented by data from elicitation work, questionnaires, and experiments, are accessible in the <a href=""https://dobes.mpi.nl/projects/bakola/"">Bagyeli/Bakola collection</a> of <em>The Language Archive</em>. With additional ethnographic, sociolinguistic, diachronic, and comparative remarks, the grammar may appeal to a wider audience in general linguistics, typology, Bantu studies, and anthropology.</p>

In the past year, several thousands of articles on COVID-19 modelling were published. The spread of the pandemic has frequently been modelled using the Susceptible- Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model owing to the low level of complexity. In recognition of its simplicity, we developed an SIR model to represent the spread of disease on a global scale, irrespective of mutation and countermeasures. The SIR parameters were reverse-engineered from aggregated global data. This model is the first to retrospectively deduce the initial incidence. The average transmission and recovery parameters were computed to be 0.33 week^{&minus;1} and 0.23 week^{&minus;1} , respectively. These values lie well within the range of reported values on COVID-19 determined from geographically different regions. The model was simulated in the Ventana&reg;&nbsp;simulation environment Vensim&reg;&nbsp;for a 65-weeks duration and an adjusted initial infection incidence, which was presumed three times the reported initial infection incidence. The simulated data visually aligns with the real incidence data. We attribute the discrepancy between the presumed initial value and the reported value to lack of testing facilities on the starting date of 1 March 2020. Our parameter extraction suggests a novel methodology to quantify undertesting retrospectively in epidemics.</p>",125,41,"Carlson, Craig S.","University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg","0000-0003-1059-1601","2021-07-09","2021-09-02","CC-BY-4.0","system dynamics, coronavirus model, SIR model, parameter extraction"

The structure of the raw data is highly complex, so converting it to meaningful insight requires data curation, integration, extraction and visualization, the global crowdsourcing of which provides both additional challenges and opportunities. Wikidata is an interdisciplinary, multilingual, open collaborative knowledge base of more than 90 million entities connected by well over a billion relationships. It acts as a web-scale platform for broader computer-supported cooperative work and linked open data, since it can be written to and queried in multiple ways in near real time by specialists, automated tools and the public. The main query language, SPARQL, is a semantic language used to retrieve and process information from databases saved in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, we introduce four aspects of Wikidata that enable it to serve as a knowledge base for general information on the COVID-19 pandemic: its flexible data model, its multilingual features, its alignment to multiple external databases, and its multidisciplinary organization. The rich knowledge graph created for COVID-19 in Wikidata can be visualized, explored and analyzed for purposes like decision support as well as educational and scholarly research.</p>",233,31,"Houcemeddine Turki","Faculty of Medicine of Sfax, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","0000-0003-3492-2014","2021-06-22","2021-06-23","CC-BY-4.0","Public health surveillance, Wikidata, Knowledge graph, COVID-19, SPARQL, Community curation, FAIR data, Linked Open Data"

These practices are deployed in physical spaces called makerspaces. This generic term designates technological spaces of open innovation that are alternatively called fab labs, hubs, accelerators, incubators, hackerspaces, biohackerspaces, living labs, or coworking spaces. Makerspaces are generally equipped with digitally controlled machines, such as 3D printers or laser cutters, computer equipment, electronic kits, and a variety of other equipment or tools, like saws or sewing machines. Beyond the material aspect, makerspaces are characterized by their community dimension: regardless of their field, people with similar interests can come together to socialize, to collaborate, and to discuss common themes and problems. However, the maker movement&mdash;it is worth mentioning&mdash;is not a new phenomenon. As Michel Lallement says, &ldquo;We have always been makers.&rdquo;[1] This is all the more true in the African context, where resourcefulness, DIY, recycling, and repairing/mending practices are anchored in daily life.

The structure of the raw data is highly complex, so converting it to meaningful insight requires data curation, integration, extraction and visualization, the global crowdsourcing of which provides both additional challenges and opportunities. Wikidata is an interdisciplinary, multilingual, open collaborative knowledge base of more than 90 million entities connected by well over a billion relationships. A web-scale platform for broader computer-supported cooperative work and linked open data, it can be queried in multiple ways in near real time by specialists, automated tools and the public, including via SPARQL, a semantic query language used to retrieve and process information from databases saved in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format. Here, we introduce four aspects of Wikidata that enable it to serve as a knowledge base for general information on the COVID-19 pandemic: its flexible data model, its multilingual features, its alignment to multiple external databases, and its multidisciplinary organization. The rich knowledge graph created for COVID-19 in Wikidata can be visualized, explored and analyzed, for purposes like decision support as well as educational and scholarly research.</p>",653,186,"Houcemeddine Turki","Faculty of Medicine of Sfax, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","0000-0003-3492-2014","2021-02-19","2021-06-22","CC-BY-4.0","Public health surveillance, Wikidata, Knowledge graph, COVID-19, SPARQL, Community curation, FAIR data, Linked Open Data"

Wikidata, a collaborative and openly licensed knowledge graph available in RDF format, provides a forum for exchanging structured data. In this research paper, we catalog the rules describing relational and statistical COVID-19 epidemiological data and implement them in SPARQL, a query language for semantic databases. We demonstrate the efficiency of our methods to evaluate structured information, particularly COVID-19 knowledge in Wikidata, and consequently in collaborative ontologies and knowledge graphs, and we show the advantages and drawbacks of our proposed approach by comparing it to other methods for validation of linked web data.</p>

Souvent d&eacute;crits comme des vecteurs de changement social et d&#39;industrialisation, les makerspaces se sont rapidement export&eacute;s de l&rsquo;Occident vers le reste du monde et en Afrique en particulier. Au vu de cette expansion, je me suis interrog&eacute; sur les finalit&eacute;s soci&eacute;tales et la neutralit&eacute; de ces ateliers collaboratifs dans le contexte africain. Aborder ces interrogations demande d&rsquo;&eacute;tablir un cadre commun de lecture du contexte sociohistorique et &eacute;conomique de l&rsquo;Afrique. C&rsquo;est dans ce sens que je me suis inspir&eacute; de la pens&eacute;e d&eacute;coloniale, pour d&eacute;velopper un cadre conceptuel constitu&eacute; de la technocolonialit&eacute; et du d&eacute;veloppement local durable. Le concept de d&eacute;veloppement local durable est une alternative au paradigme dominant actuel des approches de d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; savoir les objectifs de d&eacute;veloppement durable (ODD). Il est n&eacute; des travaux sur la justice cognitive et est compos&eacute; des dimensions suivantes : la qu&ecirc;te de justice cognitive, l&#39;&eacute;conomie informelle, les biens communs, l&#39;inclusion et l&#39;autonomisation, la pens&eacute;e alternative africaine et l&#39;innovation sociale. Quant au concept de technocolonialit&eacute;, il &eacute;merge de la colonialit&eacute; et de la matrice coloniale des pouvoirs dans les technologies num&eacute;riques. Il est constitu&eacute; des dimensions suivantes : le discours techno-utopique, les pratiques n&eacute;o-capitalistes et la colonialit&eacute; des savoirs li&eacute;e au transfert de technologie. Ce cadre conceptuel m&rsquo;a permis de reformuler mon interrogation en la question de recherche suivante : &agrave; quel type de d&eacute;veloppement les makerspaces contribuent-ils en Afrique francophone ? De fa&ccedil;on sp&eacute;cifique, il s&rsquo;agit de savoir si les ateliers collaboratifs peuvent r&eacute;ellement contribuer au d&eacute;veloppement local durable en Afrique ou s&rsquo;ils contribuent &agrave; renforcer la technocolonialit&eacute;. Pour r&eacute;pondre &agrave; ces questions, j&#39;ai men&eacute; trois &eacute;tudes de cas en Afrique francophone : le Ouagalab au Burkina Faso, l&#39;Ongola Fablab au Cameroun et le Defko Ak Niep Lab au S&eacute;n&eacute;gal. Pour chaque cas, j&#39;ai collect&eacute; des donn&eacute;es en combinant trois m&eacute;thodes : l&#39;observation participante, les entretiens semi-dirig&eacute;s avec les membres et les promoteurs des makerspaces, et l&rsquo;analyse documentaire. Apr&egrave;s avoir trait&eacute; les donn&eacute;es, j&rsquo;ai proc&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; une analyse qualitative &agrave; l&#39;aide du logiciel Nvivo. Les diff&eacute;rentes cat&eacute;gories de mon analyse ont ensuite &eacute;t&eacute; compar&eacute;es et interpr&eacute;t&eacute;es en utilisant le cadre conceptuel construit au pr&eacute;alable. Mon &eacute;tude r&eacute;v&egrave;le que les makerspaces sont des communs de la connaissance qui permettent de lutter contre les injustices cognitives. &Agrave; ce titre, ils assurent l&#39;&eacute;closion des connaissances, favorisent l&#39;inclusion et l&#39;autonomisation des membres et catalysent l&#39;innovation sociale. En d&#39;autres termes, la dynamique au sein des espaces de fabrication collaboratifs est tr&egrave;s favorable au d&eacute;veloppement local durable. Par-dessus tout, les espaces de fabrication collaboratifs offrent un cadre d&rsquo;&eacute;panouissement et d&rsquo;expression du leadership des femmes, tout en leur donnant la possibilit&eacute; de lutter contre les pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s auxquels elles sont souvent confront&eacute;es dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; et le milieu des STEM (Science-Technologie-Ing&eacute;nierie et Math&eacute;matiques), cependant, les makerspaces sont expos&eacute;s &agrave; des risques de technocolonialit&eacute; qui pourraient s&eacute;rieusement entraver la dynamique interne et par cons&eacute;quent, leur contribution au d&eacute;veloppement local durable. Pour contrecarrer ces risques de technocolonialit&eacute;, quelques propositions sont faites &agrave; la fin de cette th&egrave;se, &agrave; l&rsquo;endroit des acteurs et actrices impliqu&eacute;-e-s dans l&#39;&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me des makerspaces.</p>",640,274,"Thomas Hervé Mboa Nkoudou","Université Laval","0000-0001-9678-7765","2020-12-08","2021-01-07","CC-BY-4.0","Makerspaces, technocolonialité, appropriation des technologies, études décoloniales, justice cognitive, science ouverte, développement local durable"

Global Research System, European Academic Library Collections, and Decolonisation","<p>A large part of the literature published in the &lsquo;Global South&rsquo; is barely covered by bibliographic databases. Institutional policies increasingly require researchers globally to publish in &lsquo;international&rsquo; journals, draining local infrastructures. The standard-setting power of &lsquo;Global South&rsquo; scholars is minimised further. My main aim is to render visible the ways in which European academic libraries contribute to this situation. It is explained as a consequence of specific features of current world society, referred to as coloniality, social injustice, and quantified communication. The thesis analyses peripherality conceptually and scientometrically: based on a sample, how is Southeast African basic social sciences and humanities (SSH) research integrated in global scholarly communication, and how do local dissemination infrastructures develop under these conditions? Finally, how are professional values, specifically neutrality, and workflows of European academic libraries, interrelated with these developments?</p>

<p>The methodological approach of the thesis is multi-faceted, including conceptual analyses, scientometrics, and a short survey of collection managers and an analysis of the corresponding libraries&#39; collection policies. The off-mainstream decolonial scientometric approach required the construction of a database from multiple sources. Southeast Africa was selected as a field for some of the empirical studies included, because out of all rarely studied local communities to which a peripheral status is commonly attributed, the large majority of Southeast African authors use English as their primary academic language. This excludes linguistic reasons for the peripheral attribution.</p>

<p>The theoretical and conceptual point of departure is to analyse scholarly communication as a self-referential social system with global reach (Luhmann). In this thesis, an unorthodox understanding of social systems theory is developed, providing it with cultural humility, inspired by decolonial thinking. The value of the approach lies in its in-built capacity for social change: peripheries are constructed communicatively, and culturally humble communication avoids adding to the accumulation of peripheral references attributed to the &lsquo;Global South&rsquo;, for instance by suspending the incarceration of area studies which tends to subsume any research from and about Africa as African studies, remote from the core of SSH. While centrality serves the necessary purpose of reducing the overwhelming complexity of global research, communicative centres can just as well be constructed as topical, and do not require a spatial attachment to be functional. Another advantage of this approach is its awareness of different levels of observation, differentiating, for instance, between whether the academic librarian&#39;s neutrality is imagined as playing out in interaction with the user (passive neutrality), as representing the diversity of the research system (active neutrality), or as balancing social bias running through society at large, and hence furthering social justice (culturally humble neutrality).</p>",356,271,"Nora Schmidt","Department od Arts and Cultural Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","0000-0002-7105-9515","2020-12-02","2020-12-04","CC-BY-4.0","Scholarly communication, Academic libraries, Decolonialism, Scientometrics, Critlib, Collection management"

Through systematic comparison of data from both languages, similarities, which are likely due to common semantic mechanisms of meaning extension, and differences, which are likely due to structural differences between the languages, are identified. It is argued that, despite the shared core meanings, manner demonstratives belong to different syntactic classes in Kambaata and in Wan.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are hypothesised to be linked to long-term recurrence risk due to its ability to repopulate the entire tumour population&nbsp;in a small&nbsp;number of cells. In addition, CSC as according&nbsp;to the stem&nbsp;cell model, has the property of self-renewal. Thus, only CSC has sufficient time to accumulate adequate genetic mutations that drive the acquisition of resistance against chemo- and radiation-therapy leading to initiation of recurrence. Recently,&nbsp;<em>OTX1</em>&nbsp;has been shown to be involved in the differentiation of breast CSCs into differentiated cancer cells. The gene is also reported to be involved in other cancers such as&nbsp;subset of B cells in aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas, lung cancer and most recently in bladder cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the involvement of OTX1 in cancers is demonstrated by limited number of studies, the gene remains to be an interesting candidate for further investigation. We propose that&nbsp;<em>OTX1</em>&nbsp;may be responsible for the differentiation of CSC and also promote tumour aggressiveness. We plan to establish the expression and localisation patterns of&nbsp;<em>OTX1</em>&nbsp;gene for Nigerian bladder cancer patients and&nbsp;correlate&nbsp;with clinical&nbsp;characteristics such as stage and grade; risk of recurrence; disease progression and age. To understand the role of&nbsp;<em>OTX1</em>&nbsp;in bladder cancer stem cells, the gene will be overexpressed/knockdown in non&nbsp;<em>OTX1</em>expressing and&nbsp;<em>OTX1</em>&nbsp;expressing CSCs, respectively, and the resulting phenotypic effects will be compared.</p>",129,50,"Ahmad Umar","Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Bauchi State University, Gadau, PMB 65, Itas/Gadau, Bauchi State, Nigeria","0000-0002-3216-5171","2020-10-19","2020-10-19","CC-BY-4.0","Genetic profiling, Characterization, OTX1, Bladder cancer, Stem cells"

Liver cancer also known as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in males and the seventh most common cancer in females and the third leading cause of cancer death globally [1]. Limited treatment for high-risk liver cancer and poor prognosis was recorded, in addition to its resistance, recurrence, progression and invasion. Resistance of liver cancer to conventional therapies added to severe side effects prompted the search for a novel therapeutic approach based on natural products such as the Nigerian honey. Honey and its components were documented to have significant anti-cancer activity against many types of cancer including liver cancer in both in vivo and in vitro studies. However, the mechanism of anti-cancer activity of honey as a chemopreventive and therapeutic agent has not been completely elucidated, and to our knowledge, there is no study carried out to investigate the effects of Nigerian honey on cancer cells. It is in view of this that this project aims to pre-clinically evaluate the molecular mechanism of anti-cancer activity of the Nigerian honey on liver cancer cells through the use of molecular techniques. A full understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms elicit by honey in killing cancer cells may lead to the use of the honey or its polyphenols at clinical level for effective treatment of many types of human cancer in the future.&nbsp;</p>

These proven indigenous knowledge systems have been - and continue to be - facing suppression, belittling and exploitation throughout and after colonialism.</p>

<p>In my community today around Lake Victoria, indigenous knowledge suffers isolation and extinction as the continent experiences technological advancements for the price of ecosystem destruction. Furthermore, building synergies between indigenous knowledge and modern science is still a challenge.</p>

<p>The Turkana, Maasai, Samburu and other indigenous groups in Kenya rely on their community knowledge acquired and accumulated over centuries, covering indigenous concepts about astronomy, physics, medicine, botany, zoology, psychiatry, and non-invasive technology. However, their rich knowledge base is being faced by extinction as the older generations are losing more and more opportunities of passing their knowledge on. Most indigenous languages are only spoken, hence knowledge capture is difficult.</p>

<p>I want to build a bridge between indigenous and academic knowledge systems. This will be achieved through a series of events to facilitate meetings between indigenous community representatives and local researchers to explore opportunities for collaboration utilizing the infrastructure and network created through my work with&nbsp; Pint of Science Kenya. The event series will have its peak with a sustainable science communication festival under the theme of &ldquo;Nature for Life, Life for Nature&rdquo; showcasing indigenous&nbsp;music, science and art and presenting the initiated collaborative activities and research projects while ensuring protection from misappropriation.</p>

<p>The process will be paralleled by the fostering of equitable engagement of both indigenous knowledge holders and scholarly scientists through communication and collaboration, aided by documentation and archiving in audio/visual files of interviews, video footage and scholarly documentation as with books, manuscripts and journal articles in the pan-African repository AfricArXiv.</p>

<p>Modern Science and Indigenous Science can not only co-exist but instead complement each other to allow us to tackle continental and global challenges like climate change, the pandemic, forced migration and poverty. I believe that Indigenous Knowledge deserves an equal position alongside mainstream academic science.</p>

<p>I am convinced that the global research community benefits from a balanced exchange of knowledge and experience from all parts of the world, especially as we address global challenges.</p>

Two tentative findings are put forward for further cross-linguistic examination: a &quot;rule of three&quot; that may play a role in the organization of successive response pursuits, and a striking commonality in animal-oriented recruitments across languages that may be explained by convergent cultural evolution.

Whereas the expectation is that pre-verbal constituents will be treated prosodically differently than post-verbal constituents in SVO Bantu languages, Lusoga treats both pre- and post-verbal constituents the same, including both left- and right-dislocations. While certain clitics do form a TG with the preceding word, perhaps forming a recursive phonological word, there is nothing corresponding to the multiword TG or TP of Luganda. Lusoga either fails to distinguish phonological phrases or if they do exist in the language (as universally claimed), Lusoga fails to mark them.

<p>Abstract of paper</p>

<p>Digital tools that support Open Science practices play a key role in the seamless accumulation, archiving and dissemination of scholarly data, outcomes and conclusions. Despite their integration into Open Science practices, the providence and design of these digital tools are rarely explicitly scrutinized. This means that influential factors, such as the funding models of the parent organizations, their geographic location, and the dependency on digital infrastructures are rarely considered. Suggestions from literature and anecdotal evidence already draw attention to the impact of these factors, and raise the question of whether the Open Science ecosystem can realise the aspiration to become a truly &ldquo;unlimited digital commons&rdquo; in its current structure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an online research approach, we compiled and analysed the geolocation, terms and conditions as well as funding models of 242 digital tools increasingly being used by researchers in various disciplines. Our findings indicate that design decisions and restrictions are biased towards researchers in North American and European scholarly communities. In order to make the future Open Science ecosystem inclusive and operable for researchers in all world regions including Africa, Latin America, Asia and Oceania, those should be actively included in design decision processes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital Open Science Tools carry the promise of enabling collaboration across disciplines, world regions and language groups through responsive design. We therefore encourage long term funding mechanisms and ethnically as well as culturally inclusive approaches serving local prerequisites and conditions to tool design and construction allowing a globally connected digital research infrastructure to evolve in a regionally balanced manner.</p>",197,38,"Bezuidenhout, Louise","University of Oxford","0000-0003-4328-3963","2020-09-03","2020-09-22","CC-BY-4.0",
"https://zenodo.org/api/records/4011296","10.5281/zenodo.4011296","The Privilege to Select. Global Research System, European Academic Library Collections, and Decolonisation","<p>A large part of the literature published in the &lsquo;Global South&rsquo; is barely covered by bibliographic databases. Institutional policies increasingly require researchers globally to publish in &lsquo;international&rsquo; journals, draining local infrastructures. The standard-setting power of &lsquo;Global South&rsquo; scholars is minimised further. My main aim is to render visible the ways in which European academic libraries contribute to this situation. It is explained as a consequence of specific features of current world society, referred to as coloniality, social injustice, and quantified communication. The thesis analyses peripherality conceptually and scientometrically: based on a sample, how is Southeast African basic social sciences and humanities (SSH) research integrated in global scholarly communication, and how do local dissemination infrastructures develop under these conditions? Finally, how are professional values, specifically neutrality, and workflows of European academic libraries, interrelated with these developments?</p>

<p>The methodological approach of the thesis is multi-faceted, including conceptual analyses, scientometrics, and a short survey of collection managers and an analysis of the corresponding libraries&#39; collection policies. The off-mainstream decolonial scientometric approach required the construction of a database from multiple sources. Southeast Africa was selected as a field for some of the empirical studies included, because out of all rarely studied local communities to which a peripheral status is commonly attributed, the large majority of Southeast African authors use English as their primary academic language. This excludes linguistic reasons for the peripheral attribution.</p>

<p>The theoretical and conceptual point of departure is to analyse scholarly communication as a self-referential social system with global reach (Luhmann). In this thesis, an unorthodox understanding of social systems theory is developed, providing it with cultural humility, inspired by decolonial thinking. The value of the approach lies in its in-built capacity for social change: peripheries are constructed communicatively, and culturally humble communication avoids adding to the accumulation of peripheral references attributed to the &lsquo;Global South&rsquo;, for instance by suspending the incarceration of area studies which tends to subsume any research from and about Africa as African studies, remote from the core of SSH. While centrality serves the necessary purpose of reducing the overwhelming complexity of global research, communicative centres can just as well be constructed as topical, and do not require a spatial attachment to be functional. Another advantage of this approach is its awareness of different levels of observation, differentiating, for instance, between whether the academic librarian&#39;s neutrality is imagined as playing out in interaction with the user (passive neutrality), as representing the diversity of the research system (active neutrality), or as balancing social bias running through society at large, and hence furthering social justice (culturally humble neutrality).</p>",1142,2054,"Nora Schmidt","Department od Arts and Cultural Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","0000-0002-7105-9515","2020-09-01","2020-12-02","CC-BY-4.0","Scholarly communication, Academic libraries, Decolonialism, Scientometrics, Critlib, Collection management"

different kinds of causative and applicative heads, stored separately in the lexicon,<br>

A rising number of reports from multiple countries detail these problems: lack of laboratories, reagents, technicians, and equipment form bottlenecks in both diagnosis and the race for a viable vaccine.</p>

<p>As COVID-19 cases start to appear on the African continent, questions about laboratory capacity become even more pertinent. The 2014&ndash;2016 Ebola pandemic clearly illustrated the challenges of managing pandemic responses in contexts with underresourced health infrastructures and strained laboratory testing capacity (Bell et al. 2016). In the case of the Ebola pandemic, these shortfalls were offset by a significant and sustained international response that brought equipment, testing capabilities, and streamlined supply chains into affected areas.</p>

sity&rsquo;s Department of Linguistics has had a strong and continuing presence in the study<br>
of African languages and linguistics through the work of its faculty and of its graduates<br>
on the faculties of many other universities. In 1972, the Indiana University Department<br>
of Linguistics hosted the third Annual Conference of African Linguistics. Proceedings<br>
of that conference were published by Indiana University Publications (African Series,<br>
vol. 7). In 1986, IU hosted the seventeenth Annual Conference of African Linguistics<br>
with Paul Newman and Robert Botne editing the proceedings in a volume entitled Cur-<br>
rent approaches to African linguistics, vol. 5. In 2016, Indiana University hosted the 48th<br>
Annual Conference on African Linguistics with the theme African linguistics across the<br>
disciplines. Proceedings of that meeting are published in this volume.<br>
The papers presented in this volume reflect the diversity of opportunities for lan-<br>
guage study in Africa. This collection of descriptive and theoretical work is the fruit of<br>
data gathering both in-country and abroad by researchers of languages spoken across the<br>
continent, from Sereer-Siin in the west to Somali in the northeast to Ikalanga in the south.<br>
The range of topics in this volume is also broad, representative of the varied field work in<br>
country and abroad that inspires research in African linguistics. This collection of papers<br>
spans the disciplines of phonology (both segmental and suprasegmental), morphology<br>
(both morphophonological and morphosyntactic), syntax, semantics, and language pol-<br>
icy. The data and analyses presented in this volume offer a cross-disciplinary view of<br>
linguistic topics from the many under-resourced languages of Africa.</p>",684,25,"Samson Lotven",,,"2019-11-12","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

trolled argument&rdquo;) is obligatorily bound by an argument of the immediately embed-<br>
ding predicate (the &ldquo;controller&rdquo;). Cross-linguistic research has revealed variation<br>
in how control sentences are syntactically instantiated, though no studies to date<br>
have documented cases where the controlled argument is realized by an overt lo-<br>
gophoric pronoun. Based on novel field data, we argue that precisely this happens<br>
in Gengbe (Gbe, Niger-Congo), though only with some embedding verbs (such as<br>
dʒ&iacute; &lsquo;want&rsquo;) and only when the embedded clause has potential (as opposed to jus-<br>
sive) mood marking. We propose an account of the facts whereby control comple-<br>
ments are property-denoting and whereby logophoricity and jussive mood are two<br>
independent routes for creating property-denoting clauses. The upshot is a view of<br>
control as an emergent phenomenon; there is no &ldquo;control construction&rdquo; or &ldquo;control<br>
pronoun&rdquo; (pro) but rather several independent components of the grammar that in-<br>
teract to give rise to control under certain conditions for principled type-theoretic<br>
reasons.</p>",12,10,"Thomas Grano","Indiana University",,"2019-11-12","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

I show that Ibibio logophors, although they behave in most respects like typical<br>
logophoric pronouns in West African languages, obey Shift Together like shifted<br>
indexicals. In order to explain this data I propose that Ibibio logophors are sensitive<br>
to two operators in the left periphery of the embedded CP: a shifting operator and<br>
a logophoric binding operator. Ibibio indexicals (which do not shift) differ in that<br>
they are defined to be insensitive to shifting operators. Thus indexical shift requires<br>
cooperation between the semantics of the indexical and of the shifting operator.<br>

from the interaction with aspectual classes in Nyamwezi, a Bantu language spoken<br>
in Tabora, Tanzania. The study is motivated by two observations. Firstly, in previ-<br>
ous analyses (Maganga &amp; Schadeberg 1992), it was noted that -&oslash;-...-&iacute;le in Nyamwezi<br>
selects few verbs, but the patterns governing its distribution were not identified.<br>
Secondly, not much has been done on describing the semantics of verbal roots in<br>
Nyamwezi (and many other Bantu languages), which appears to be a source of vari-<br>
able temporal interpretations of -&oslash;-...-&iacute;le. Based on field data, I show that the first<br>
main function of -&oslash;-...-&iacute;le is that of stativizer. That is, -&oslash;-...-&iacute;le picks out a phase<br>
of an event or the entire event (if the event lacks phasic structure) and presents<br>
it as a stable, undifferentiated property. -&oslash;-...-&iacute;le does so in three different ways,<br>
which give three different readings: (i) resultative, when it occurs with achieve-<br>
ments, (ii) general present, which occurs with statives and (iii) a progressive-like<br>
reading, which occurs with some activity verbs classified as &ldquo;directed motion verbs&rdquo;<br>
in this study. The discussion of the contrast between these readings is informed by<br>
a progressive form -lɪɪ-. Many other activity verbs do not typically occur with -&oslash;-<br>
...-&iacute;le. Those that occur with this construction either suggest the change-of-state<br>
or condition of the verb&rsquo;s subject (which has the semantic role of patient; patien-<br>
tive subject) or they are used in a special pragmatic condition where -&oslash;-...-&iacute;le is<br>
coerced. Coercion of -&oslash;-...-&iacute;le expresses a contradiction and/or emphasis, which<br>
can be regarded as a second main function of this construction.</p>",12,6,"Ponsiano Sawaka Kanijo","University of Gothenburg",,"2019-11-12","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

Akan (Asante Twi) determiner bi which hitherto had not been discussed in the<br>
Akan literature. In previous studies, Amfo (2010) and Arkoh (2011) review its ref-<br>
erential or specific indefinite interpretation. The current study shows that in addi-<br>
tion to the above interpretation when bi is used, the speaker signals that she does<br>
not have access to all the information about who or what satisfies the existential<br>
claim they are making. I employ Aloni (2001) and Aloni &amp; Port&rsquo;s (2015) theory of<br>
conceptual covers and methods of identification to determine &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; of a<br>
referent in a particular context. Conceptual covers are sets of individual concepts<br>
which exclusively and exhaustively covers the domain of individuals (Aloni 2001).<br>
I show that the epistemic indefinite analysis and the specificity or referential anal-<br>
ysis are compatible. When bi is used, the speaker asserts she can name a notewor-<br>
thy or identifying property about the referent of the NP, which is the referential or<br>
specificity interpretation. Additionally, she presupposes that she is ignorant about<br>
further characterizing information about the referent, the epistemic indefinite in-<br>

Previous work on Somali tone suggests that most determiners and all nominal modifiers should realize a High tone when they combine with the noun they modify. However, our study finds that there is considerable variability in the realization of High tones on nominal determiners and modifiers, with the High tone often not realized. This phenomenon of variability in tone realization is quite reminiscent of Swedish, which shares with Somali the property that tone realization is culminative within some prosodic domain. Recent work on Swedish has argued that variable non-realization of High tone is best analyzed as prosodic restructuring: reducing the number of culminative tonal domains in a construction necessarily leads to a reduction in the number of surface High tones. We argue that prosodic domain restructuring also provides the most plausible analysis of High tone reduction in Somali nominals.</p>",240,32,"Laura J.

only for linguistic and analytical reasons, but also because most designers of these<br>
orthographies have been educated in non-tonal languages. After a review of lexical<br>
vs. grammatical tone, this paper examines various strategies that have been used<br>
for marking both lexical and grammatical tone in several East and West African<br>
languages, as well as cases in which tone is not marked. The question of the desired<br>
phonological depth of an orthography is discussed, especially when applied<br>
to tonal processes. Many phonologists do not apply theory more recent than Chomsky<br>
and Halle &amp; Chomsky (1968) to orthographies. However, the more recent bifurcation<br>
of rules into lexical and postlexical provides a psycholinguistically supported<br>
phonological level at which tone marking can be based: the output of the<br>
lexical level. Experimental evidence supports this lexical level as more readable<br>
than either a phonemic or a deep level. A tonal typology of languages also guides<br>
what types of languages more predictably would need lexical tone marking. Recommendations<br>
for orthographical implementation are given in the conclusion.</p>",32,20,"Michael Cahill","SIL international",,"2019-11-12","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

The underlying syllable structure is limited to C(C)V and V syllable, thus syllables with an onset and syllables consisting with a nucleus and nothing else. The onset can be complex, although it is limited to two positions which are restricted in their order by the sonority sequence principle. By contrast, the surface syllables are the result of phonological changes that take place in specific morphological environments. Vowel deletion happens regularly when two identical vowels are separated by a consonant in the context C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>.C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>. there is also a process of liquid deletion that simplifies underlying complex onsets. However, when the complex onset is the result of vowel deletion, liquid deletion does not apply: The two processes&mdash;syllable become more complex or syllable are simplified&mdash;are in a counterfeeding relation to each other. The last process that is described is fusion of two monosyllabic morphemes into a single syllable. If the second morpheme is w&iacute; with a glide in its onset, the fusion results in a CV syllable with a round vowel. Otherwise the emerging syllable is CVC where the first CV is the entire first morpheme and the second C is the consonant of the second morpheme. The results of the study of syllable structure is tested on loanwords, where syllables&#39; repairs take place. For instance, codas are avoided by epenthesis and unallowed initial vowels trigger epenthesis of an onset segment [h]. It is also shown how the constraints on syllable structure repair loanwords in Fr&ograve;ʔ&ograve;</p>",20,14,"Yranahan Traoré",,,"2019-11-12","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

Typologically rare features may spill out beyond the bounds of an otherwise well-defined linguistic area. Rather than viewing the &quot;fuzzy&quot; boundary of a linguistic area as a problem, it can instead be seen to be an integral part of the structure of the linguistic area which may include a core, &quot;depleted core&quot;, fringe and even areas beyond the fringe. Clicks are a typical feature of the Kalahari Basin linguistic area, but their patterning on the fringes of this area is not so well-known. Clicks have been borrowed into Bantu languages spoken on the fringes of the area, but their functional load, as measured by the number of click phonemes and frequency of clicks in the lexicon, is lower than in the languages of the core of the area. Clicks have also been borrowed into Bantu languages spoken beyond the fringe of the area, but the functional load of clicks in these ultimate recipients is very low. Processes of click loss, both in Bantu languages and Khoisan languages on the fringe, show the same geographical patterning. The geographical distribution of clicks in southern Africa can be compared to the situation in eastern Africa, where there is evidence for an old linguistic area including Hadza and Sandawe in its core and Dahalo in its fringe.</p>",58,31,"Bonny Sands","Northern Arizona University",,"2019-08-28","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0","areal linguistics, borrowing, functional load, phonological change, linguistic divergence"

We demonstrate that apparent examples of this word order have important structural differences across languages. We show that SAuxOV orders in some languages are due to mixed clausal headedness, consisting of a head initial TP and head-final VP, though this order can be concealed by verb movement. Other languages are more consistently head-initial, and what appear to be SAuxOV orders arise in limited syntactic contexts due to specific syntactic constructions such as object shift or nominalized complements. Finally, we show that languages which have genuine SAuxOV, corresponding to a head-final VP, tend to exhibit head-final properties more generally. This observation supports the idea that syntactic typology is most productively framed in terms of structural analyses of languages rather than the existence of surface word orders.</p>",25,20,"Hannah Sande","Georgetown University",,"2019-08-28","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

The vowel quality modification is comprised of two separate processes where either lowering and removal of breathiness is applied or raising and addition of breathiness. Thus, vowel quality modification yields two separate series of mutated vowels. We provide arguments for treating some vowels as basic, while others as derived. We also identify tonal patterns found in verbal morphology, and three types of morphologically triggered consonantal lenition.

ejective components. Several articulatory coping mechanisms have been observed<br>
across languages (Maddieson 1997; 1998). In the case of Tigrinya, Shosted &amp; Rose<br>

(/s&rsquo;/ produced as [ts&rsquo;]), proposing affrication to be another possible coping mech-<br>

possible stem-internal positions, each of which occurs commonly within Bantu<br>
melodic tone systems. This simplification is achieved by (a) rejecting the existence<br>

guage variety spoken primarily in the city of Merca in southern Somalia, as well as<br>
by several diaspora communities around the world, and in particular, in the United<br>
States. Marka is interesting to us for a variety of reasons, not the least of which<br>
is the general dearth of descriptive work on the language in comparison to two<br>
of its closest relatives, Somali and Maay. While many details of the structure of<br>
Somali are fairly well established (e.g., Bell 1953; Saeed 1999), and those of Maay<br>
are the subject of several recent works (e.g., Paster 2010; 2018), the various ways in<br>
which Marka relates to and/or differs from these languages, are yet poorly under-<br>
stood. Our goal in this paper is to begin to remedy this situation, beginning with a<br>
comparison of selected morphological characteristics across the three languages.</p>

nation in Limbum. On the basis of an acoustic study of novel data, we claim that<br>
Limbum has a phrase-final low boundary tone (L%) that interacts with lexical tones<br>
to give rise to hybrid falling tones: tones whose specifications are partially lexical<br>
and partially phrasal. We argue that hybrid tones and other tonal processes in Lim-<br>
bum are readily captured in an analysis that assumes tonal geometry and empty<br>
nodes. We propose to represent L% as a floating low register feature (l) that links<br>
to lexical tonal root nodes, giving rise to various surface patterns depending on the<br>
tonal specifications of the root nodes. Our account supersedes previous analyses<br>
in terms of tone sandhi rules.</p>

languages to have what has been called a restricted tone system: all words must<br>
have a High tone. This kind of prosodic system has stress-like properties, and func-<br>
tions similar to Kisseberth &amp; Odden (2003). Vail (1972) suggests that Tumbuka is a<br>
purely stress language. This paper argues, in contrast, that because Tumbuka High<br>
tone realization has tone-like properties, as defined in Hyman (2006; 2009; 2012;<br>
2014), as well as stress-like properties, it cannot be considered a canonical stress<br>
language. It is proposed that the synchronic Tumbuka prosodic system evolved<br>
from one where contrastive High tone takes a phrasal domain through processes<br>
&ndash; formalizable as an OT factorial typology &ndash; which made phrasal prosody more<br>
transparently predictable by eliminating most tonal contrasts.</p>

In some dialect(s) of Setswana, a much different type of palatalization occurs: alveolar stridents /s ts tsʰ/ become pre-palatal [ʃ tʃ tʃʰ] before back vowels and the glide [w]. Clear empirical support for this pattern comes from productive alternations induced by the nominalizing suffix /-ɔ/, as well as alternations with an assortment of less productive morphemes, and lexical evidence. If palatalization before front vocoids is phonetically natural, then palatalization before back vocoids seems like it must be phonetically unnatural. However, this paper suggests that it is not the case: palatalization before back vowels actually makes phonetic sense, as a consequence of using lip rounding as a phonetic enhancement of the S~&Scaron; distinction.</p>",10,5,"Wm.

Examination of a small corpus of Logoori texts of various genres told by diverse speakers shows that recapitulative linkage is limited to the genre in which actions are most central: procedural texts. In descriptive texts, where concepts rather than actions are topical, recapitulation occurs in the vessel of NPs, not verbs. Both types of recapitulation are largely absent from narratives. In Logoori recapitulative linkage, the predicate in the bridging clause uniformly takes the Immediate Perfect inflection, meaning ``X having just Ved&#39;&#39;. The semantics of this inflection entail that bridging constructions cement a tight sequential relationship between the action described in the reference clause and the clause after the bridging clause. But even within the procedural text genre, recapitulative linkage is unevenly distributed and is apparently replaceable: one speaker uses the Immediate Perfect within a procedural text to effect the same sequential relationship as recapitulative linkage, but without lexical repetition. The intra-genre uneven distribution of bridging constructions, and their absence from narratives, point to their non-essentiality to Logoori discourse coherence.</p>",90,10,"Hannah Sarvasy","MARCS Institute, Western Sydney University",,"2019-03-14","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

Pichi features a nominative-accusative alignment, SVO word order, adjective-noun order, prenominal determiners, and prepositions. The language has a seven-vowel system and twenty-two consonant phonemes. Pichi has a two-tone system with tonal minimal pairs, morphological tone, and tonal processes. The morphological structure is largely isolating. Pichi has a rich system of tense-aspect-mood marking, an indicative-subjunctive opposition, and a complex copular system with several suppletive forms. Many features align Pichi with the Atlantic-Congo languages spoken in the West African littoral zone. At the same time, characteristics like the prenominal position of adjectives and determiners show a typological overlap with its lexifier English, while extensive contact with Spanish has left an imprint on the lexicon and grammar as well.</p>",736,112,"Yakpo, Kofi",,,"2019-02-20","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

They show systems of alternating prefixes and alliterative concord, as well as diminutive and augmentative prefixes and CV- prefixes with underspecified vowels, where the -V of the prefix harmonises with the stem vowel. The limited segmental cognates point to radical restructuring through affix loss and renewal. Indeed one language, Shen, has lost all nominal morphology and it is severely reduced in some branches. Reshe is typologically similar to other Kainji languages, but the affixes seem to have been completely restructured. The paper presents an overview of the literature on Kainji and then describes the nominal affixing in individual branches.

However, these languages show evidence of the original third person pronouns which have been restricted to a logophoric function.

groups, comparing them to Cameroonian Bantu zone A. Extending my survey of<br>
Niger-Congo extensions (Hyman 2007), I show that there is a band of contiguous<br>
languages in the Grassfields area where a number of contrastive verb extensions<br>
have relative productivity (cf. the studies in Idiata &amp; Mba 2003). Interestingly, the<br>
languages in question belong to several subgroups: Limbum (NE Eastern Grass-<br>
fields Bantu), Noni (Beboid), Kom and Babanki (Ring Western Grassfields Bantu),<br>
Bafut and Mankon (Ngemba Eastern Grassfields Bantu). Other languages in these<br>
same subgroups are not in this geographical band and have very few extensions.<br>
The above-mentioned languages allow a possible reconstruction of *CV extensions<br>
with *s, *t, *n, *l, *k, and *m. A major property of Bantoid extensions is the rela-<br>
tive frequency of aspectual-type extensions, especially marking different types of<br>
pluractionality (iterative, frequentative, distributive, repetitive), diminutive (atten-<br>
uation of action), and intensive (augmentation of action) semantics. In many lan-<br>
guages the same suffix form covers two or more of these functions. The hypothesis<br>
is that the original system was more like Proto-Bantu, with extensions being more<br>
valence-related, but over time these very same extensions became reinterpreted<br>
as aspectual. However, the great variety of extensions in and outside of Bantoid<br>
suggests that there may have been more extensions at a pre-Proto-Bantu stage.</p>

of the prefix /ne-/. This prefix displays a varied syntactic distribution, posing a puzzle as to<br>
what semantically unifies all of its uses. In focus constructions, /ne-/ obligatorily appears<br>
on a fronted (i.e. focused) phrase, whereas in simple declaratives, /ne-/ obligatorily appears<br>
pre-verbally. Following previous analyses of similar markers in Bantu (Schwarz 2007 for<br>
Kikuyu and Abels &amp; Muriungi 2008 for Kiitharaka), we analyze /ne-/ uniformly as a focus<br>
marker that arises in a focus phrase in the left periphery. We support this account of /ne-<br>
/ by presenting novel data that suggest that even when /ne-/ occurs pre-verbally, it still<br>
marks focus (VP focus or sentential focus.) We also show how /ne-/ differs syntactically<br>
from similar markers in other languages. For example, Kuria allows for the focus marker to<br>
appear internal to the focused constituent, in contrast with data from Kiitharaka (Abels &amp;<br>
Muriungi 2008) and other languages (see Hartmann &amp; Zimmermann 2009 for Guruntum).<br>
This paper thus discusses a range of data patterns relating to the Kuria prefix /ne-/, offering<br>

tic contexts, not simply for assigning argument focus to the A term (Lambrecht 1994) but<br>
also for identifying an A when the P term is in focus; for highlighting brand new A partic-<br>

for marking the A of quotative constructions and embedded relative clauses.<br>

to focus constituents other than transitive actors.</p>

In languages such as English, there is a clearly distinct category of adjectives. But in other languages the category of adjectives is not entirely distinct morphologically and syntactically from nouns and verbs. In this paper I show that there is a striking resemblance between adjectives and nouns in Lubukusu. In addition, stage-level predicate meanings are expressed by use of verbs rather than adjectives. Because of these facts, it is tempting to adopt an analysis that reduces Lubukusu adjectives to either nouns or verbs. However, I argue that there is not sufficient evidence to support such an analysis. Lubukusu has true adjectives in spite of the associated nominal and verbal characteristics. A verbal characteristic such as expressing adjectival meanings by use verbs is similar to languages such Mohawk and Vaeakau-Taumako. But there are significant differences between these languages and Lubukusu with regards to this verbal characteristic.</p>",23,14,"Aggrey Wasike",,,"2018-06-29","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

English an event which took place and was completed in the past. The linguistic phenomena<br>
understudy informs us that English uses the simple past in a past-completed event while<br>
French and Lingala use the &lsquo;pass&eacute; compos&eacute;&rsquo; and the remote or recent past, respectively. The<br>
study circumscribes the tense similarities and differences between the three languages.<br>
The paper strives to answer the questions on which previously acquired language between<br>
the l1, l2, or both l1 &amp; l2 overrides in l3 syntactic transfer. The paper aims to determine<br>
whether the l2 is the privileged source of syntactic transfer even when the l1 offers syn-<br>
tactic similarities with the l3. Finally, the study purports to determine whether subjects are<br>
more accurate when communicating in explicit mode than in implicit mode. That is, the<br>
study further aims to investigate whether subjects make less transfer errors in a task that<br>
promotes reliance on explicit knowledge than they do in task that promotes reliance on<br>
implicit knowledge.<br>
The findings of the study show that subjects used the simple past tense in the context of a<br>
past-completed event. The use of the simple past tense in the context of a past-completed<br>
event might be attributed to transfer from the l1 or might be considered as a consequence<br>
of positive learning.<br>
The results further show that subjects have transferred more explicit knowledge than im-<br>
plicit. And the results have ruled out the l2-status factor claim that the l2 is the privileged<br>
source of transfer in l3 acquisition.</p>

In Seereer (Atlantic, Senegal), singular pronominal objects are obligatorily marked by an ob-<br>
ject suffix on the verb. This paper provides the first comprehensive description of this object<br>
suffixation pattern, a topic that has been only cursorily described in the extant literature on<br>
Seereer (cf. Renaudier 2012). In addition, I provide a preliminary theoretical account of the<br>
Seereer object suffix system. I argue that Seereer object suffixes are best analyzed as incorpo-<br>
rated pronouns. Evidence for such an analysis comes from the following: (i) an object suffix<br>
may never occur with an in situ object DP; (ii) an object suffix may not double an extracted<br>
object in relative clauses, wh-questions, or focus constructions; (iii) there is only one object<br>
suffix allowed per clause; and (iv) an object suffix may reference either object in a double<br>
object construction. I argue that object suffixes raise to Spec-vP and are subsequently incor-<br>
porated in the verb via m-merger (Matushansky 2006, Kramer 2014, Harizanov 2014). This<br>
analysis elegantly derives the behaviors listed above. Such an approach also allows us to<br>
integrate the Seereer object suffixation data into the broader understanding of cliticization<br>
patterns crosslinguistically, thereby enriching our understanding of object marking systems<br>
in verbs.</p>

comparison of singular to plural template correspondences proposed by Gadalla (2000). The<br>
theoretical side of this analysis builds upon Alain Kihm&rsquo;s realizational &ldquo;Root-and-Site Hy-<br>

as approachable in the same manner when discussing inflection as not only represented in<br>
segments but also as &ldquo;sites&rdquo; where inflectional operations may take place (Kihm 2006: 69). To<br>
organize the data through a computational lens, I emulate Kihm&rsquo;s approach in DATR, a lexi-<br>

broken and regular plural nouns. The hierarchically-structured inheritance of DATR allows<br>
for default templates to be defined and overridden, permitting a wide scope of variation to<br>
be represented with little code content. Overall, the analysis reveals that complex morpho-<br>

guages of the Eastern Omo-Tana subgroup of East Cushitic (including Maay, Somali, Rendille,<br>
and Tunni) have gender systems wherein every noun is masculine or feminine. Masculine<br>
nouns take k-initial variants of suffixes including the definite marker, demonstratives, and<br>
possessive markers; these suffixes are t-initial with feminine nouns. As is now well known,<br>
gender in these languages is sensitive to plurality in various ways: in some languages, gen-<br>
der &lsquo;polarity&rsquo; reverses the gender of nouns in the plural; in others, feminine nouns change<br>
to masculine when their plurals are formed with certain suffixes but not others. In Maay,<br>
plurals are all masculine regardless of how they are formed, but the gender of many singu-<br>
lar nouns is inconsistent across individuals. The masculine plural pattern makes the gender<br>
of singular nouns unrecoverable from their plurals, so nouns that are frequently plural are<br>
susceptible to gender instability. If there is uncertainty about the gender of some nouns,<br>
speakers may be inclined to guess masculine, thereby producing more feminine to mascu-<br>
line changes than the reverse, due to the prevalence of masculine nouns in the Maay lexicon.</p>

porated pronoun and never a non-referential marker of grammatical agreement&rdquo; (Bresnan<br>
&amp; Mchombo 1987: 755). That is, in order for an overt nominal phrase (DP) to co-occur in<br>
the same sentence with an object prefix, the DP must be a dislocated Topic. Conversely, a<br>
dislocated object DP (a Topic) must be anaphorically bound to an object prefix. In this pa-<br>
per I present new Chichewa data showing that in modern colloquial Chichewa there is a<br>
human/non-human asymmetry in object marking. Human object DPs commonly co-occur<br>
with an object prefix, whether the object is a dislocated Topic or not, whereas non-human<br>
ones commonly do not co-occur with an object prefix, even when they are dislocated Top-<br>
ics. I conclude that Chichewa shows differential object marking (or object indexation), as hu-<br>

plex construction &rarr; bipartite stem. Finally, an overt genitive prefix that marks lexical<br>
possessors of incorporated noun phrases is reanalyzed as an accusative case prefix. These<br>
changes introduce new complexity into Coptic Differential Argument Marking: not only<br>

ern African Khoisan &ndash; show an accusative marker, typically a postposition which in its<br>
elsewhere form has the shape (-)(ʔ)&agrave;. In all languages for which adequate data is available,<br>
this postposition is optional on object NPs, at least in some circumstances. A few proposals<br>
have been made for the grammaticalisation of this marker, notably by Kilian-Hatz (2008: 55;<br>
2013: 376&ndash;378). However, not only are these proposals specific to the Khwe language, but<br>
also they fail to account for the fact that (-)(ʔ)&agrave; marks the accusative and that it is optional.<br>
In this paper I widen the net to the Khoe family as a whole, and consider the synchronic sit-<br>
uations for the usage of the marker (-)(ʔ)&agrave; and its putative cognates in those languages for<br>
which pertinent data is available. This is used to motivate a diachronic proposal concern-<br>
ing the grammaticalisation of (-)(ʔ)&agrave; in the modern languages. Specifically, it is proposed<br>
that the accusative marker began life as a presentative copula; this served to index an item,<br>
drawing the addressee&rsquo;s attention to it. It later became an optional accusative marker via<br>
grammaticalisation processes akin to those outlined in McGregor (2008; 2010; 2013; 2017)<br>
for the development of optional ergative case markers in some Australian languages. Thus<br>
the grammaticalisation scenario proposed is consistent with pathways of development of<br>
other optional case-markers.</p>

This squib discusses the syntax of ellipsis in Arabic fragments answers focusing on whether or not ellipsis in fragmentary utterances contains syntactic structure and whether, if so, such fragmentary XPs can be derived via A-bar movement to a clause-initial position plus TP deletion at PF in a way similar to that of Merchant (2004). It is argued that ellipsis in Arabic fragment answers contains syntactic structure and therefore can be analysed as TP ellipsis derived by focus movement of the remnant to a left peripheral position followed by deletion of the TP constituting the background information. Such an analysis captures some morpho-syntactic effects such as morphological case-matching, preposition-stranding, and islands effects.</p>",36,22,"Ali Algryani","The Libyan Academy",,"2018-01-08","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

Clear cases of copulas cognate with &lsquo;see/look&rsquo; verbs are found in several branches of the Mande family, and there is convincing evidence that they did not develop from the semantic bleaching of forms originally meaning &lsquo;is seen/found&rsquo; (another plausible grammaticalization path leading from &lsquo;see&rsquo; verbs to copulas), but from the routinization of the ostensive use of the imperative of &lsquo;see/look&rsquo;. Comparison of the Mande data with the Arabic data provided by Taine-Cheikh (2013) shows however that this is not the only possibility for imperatives of &lsquo;see/look&rsquo; verbs to grammaticalize into copulas, since in the Arabic varieties in which the imperative form of &lsquo;see&rsquo; has become a plain copula, the most plausible explanation is that a modal/discursive particle resulting from the grammaticalization of the imperative of &lsquo;see&rsquo; has undergone a process of semantic bleaching in the context of an equative or locational predicative construction that initially included no overt predicator.</p>",47,39,"Denis Creissels","University of Lyon",,"2017-11-14","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

I address the different strategies that are adopted as these languages lose applicative &ldquo;verb extensions&rdquo; found elsewhere in Bantu and Niger-Congo. I show that although historical recipient, benefactive, and instrumental applicative marking on verbs allowed multiple object noun phrases (send-APPL chief letter, cook-APPL child rice, cut-APPL knife meat), they have been replaced by adpositional phrases and/or serial verb constructions in all branches of Bantoid. I map out the different analytic strategies that have been adopted and reconstruct the original verbal, nominal and pronominal sources of the different grammaticalization processes. Of particular interest is the development of a recipient/benefactive preposition &lsquo;to, for&rsquo; from the word for &lsquo;hand&rsquo; and a comitative/instrumental preposition &lsquo;with&rsquo; from a third person plural pronoun.</p>",15,25,"Larry M.

The grammar was developed from hours and years that the authors spent at friends&rsquo; houses hearing and recording stories, hours spent listening to the tapes and transcribing the stories, then translating them and studying the language through them. Time was spent together and with others speaking the language and talking about it, translating resources and talking to Moloko people about them. Grammar and phonology discoveries were made in the office, in the fields while working, and at gatherings. In the process, the four authors have become more and more passionate about the Moloko language and are eager to share their knowledge about it with others.</p>

<p>Intriguing phonological aspects of Moloko include the fact that words have a consonantal skeleton and only one underlying vowel (but with ten phonetic variants). The simplicity of the vowel system contrasts with the complexity of the verb word, which can include information (in addition to the verbal idea) about subject, direct object (semantic Theme), indirect object (recipient or beneficiary), direction, location, aspect (Imperfective and Perfective), mood (indicative, irrealis, iterative), and Perfect aspect. Some of the fascinating aspects about the grammar of Moloko include transitivity issues, question formation, presupposition, and the absence of simple adjectives as a grammatical class. Most verbs are not inherently transitive or intransitive, but rather the semantics is tied to the number and type of core grammatical relations in a clause. Morphologically, two types of verb pronominals indicate two kinds of direct object; both are found in ditransitive clauses. Noun incorporation of special &lsquo;body-part&rsquo; nouns in some verbs adds another grammatical argument and changes the lexical characteristics of the verb. Clauses of zero transitivity can occur in main clauses due to the use of dependent verb forms and ideophones. Question formation is interesting in that the interrogative pronoun is clause-final for most constructions. The clause will sometimes be reconfigured so that the interrogative pronoun can be clause-final. Expectation is a foundational pillar for Moloko grammar. Three types of irrealis mood relate to speaker&rsquo;s expectation concerning the accomplishment of an event. Clauses are organised around the concept of presupposition, through the use of the na-construction. Known or expected elements are marked with the na particle. There are no simple adjectives in Moloko; all adjectives are derived from nouns. The authors invite others to further explore the intricacies of the phonology and grammar of this intriguing language.</p>",603,152,"Friesen, Dianne","SIL International",,"2017-07-13","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

By contrast, in Tashlhiyt, a Berber language, words can be composed entirely of voiceless segments. When an utterance consists of such words, the phonetic opportunity for the execution of intonational pitch movements is exceptionally limited. This book explores in a series of production and perception experiments how these typologically rare phonotactic patterns interact with intonational aspects of linguistic structure. It turns out that Tashlhiyt allows for a tremendously flexible placement of tonal events. Observed intonational structures can be conceived of as different solutions to a functional dilemma: The requirement to realise meaningful pitch movements in certain positions and the extent to which segments lend themselves to a clear manifestation of these pitch movements.</p>",485,372,"Roettger, Timo B.","University of Cologne",,"2017-07-07","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",

In Lusoga, both derivational and inflectional categories may be multiply exponed. The trigger of multiple exponence is the reciprocal suffix, which optionally triggers the doubling both of preceding derivational suffixes and of following inflectional suffixes. In these cases, each of the doubled affixes appear both before (closer to the root) and after the reciprocal. We attribute this pattern to restructuring, arguing that the inherited Bantu stem consisting of a root + suffixes has been reanalyzed as a compound-like structure with two internal constituents, the second headed by the reciprocal morpheme, each potentially undergoing parallel derivation and inflection.</p>",25,10,"Hyman, Larry M.","University of California, Berkeley",,"2017-05-23","2020-12-08","CC-BY-4.0",
